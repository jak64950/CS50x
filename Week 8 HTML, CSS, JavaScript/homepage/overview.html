          <p id="box">Hello, my name is Bill Astronaut. I am a retired Astronaut who has been in space over three years cumulative. I started Astronaut Training Command so that everyone could have a fair opportunity to achieve their dreams of going to space.
            My training is not easy and will require extreme resilience in order to get through, but it is what is required. Your body and mind will be tested like nothing you have experienced before, but at the end you will have the proper training needed
            to apply to any space program for a chance to go to the stars.
            <br><br>
            Our training program is split into two packages. In Space Cadet, you will learn to dive up to your Open Water certification, learn to fly to get your Private Pilot's license, and gain elementary proficiency in a foreign language. Our
            follow-on program, Astronaut, will advance all of the skills learned in Space Cadet. You will continue diving until you receive your Master Diver certification, flying up to your Commercial Pilot's license, and gain full professional fluency
            in a foreign language.
